				<h2>Augmen-What?</h2>
				<p>Augmented reality is the technology of overlaying computer generated imagery on top of what is already visible in the real world. It can be seen on a TV, phone, tablet, or even projected onto a headset. The important part is that it allows users to view information while still being able to see the world around them.</p>

				<h2>Augmented Reality vs. Virtual Reality</h2>
				<p>Virtual reality is when the entirety of one's surroundings are generated by a computer. VR involves a headset that completely obscures one's view, allowing the entirety of one's vision to be filled by a simulation. Examples include the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, Google Cardboard, and Playstation VR.</p>
				<p>Augmented reality is when one's surroundings are supplemented, or augmented, by computer imagery. The entire point of AR is that it does <em>not</em> obscure one's view, instead providing them with relevant information while allowing immersion in the real world.</p>

			<p>For many people, their first encounter with AR was on September 27<sup>th</sup>, 1998, when ESPN and Sportvision introduced the yellow first down line for football games, generated with AR technology.</p>

				<p>Unlike virtual reality, augmented reality technology is not limited to overhead headsets. Any time a computer is drawing imagery on top of the real world, that's AR. Everything from the graphics during a sports broadcast viewed on TV, such as the NFL's iconic first down line, to videos seen on a phone, such as Snapchat's filters or Pokemon Go, and everything inbetween are all classified as augmented reality. AR is everywhere. For more examples, see the <a href="/uses">uses</a> page.</p>
