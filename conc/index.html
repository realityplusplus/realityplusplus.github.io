				<h2>Safety</h2>
				<p>Augmented reality may make lives easier, but it comes with various associated risks. Google Glass in particular has many safety concerns. When a user is driving, they may become distracted by the constant flow of images onto the screen of the Glass and that could cause an accident, resulting in injury or even death. There’s also the very real possibility that hackers could project their own images into the Glass, such as a false speed limit sign, and make the driver act dangerously without realizing their error.</p>
				<p>Pokemon Go has dangerous problems of its own. Players would often get distracted looking at their devices and would walk into streets haphazardly in the search of a Pokemon. Drivers also frequently found themselves playing the game while driving, causing hundreds of accidents.</p>

				<h2>Privacy</h2>
				<p>If enough data is stored on anything, it becomes a wealth of information on its user. Simply by hacking someone’s phone, a hacker can discover much about a person. The same risks apply with augmented reality. When one’s reality is augmented and stored, a hacker can find this stored information and discover much about this person. For example, by looking at a person’s saved locations on any map application, a hacker can discover their home, place of work, and other important locations. Any breach into the world of augmented reality puts its user creates risks, all of which must be alleviated sooner rather than later.</p>
