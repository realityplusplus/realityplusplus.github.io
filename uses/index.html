					<h2>Headsets</h2>
					<p>Headsets take the reality you see and amplify it with the information you need. Google Glass and Microsoft Hololens are famous examples of this: it takes the information you’d otherwise look at your phone to find and puts it on your glasses. Their versatility allows them to be useful to everyone, no matter for what they’re needed.</p>

					<h2>Social Media</h2>
					<p>Social media allows people to connect with each other, such as by letting a user offer their experience in the world to everyone else. These experiences can be augmented and transmitted to others through augmented reality. Snapchat, for example, offers augmented reality to its users in the form of filters, with which a picture can be modified to add anything from icons to dog ears.</p>

					<h2>Gaming</h2>
					<p>Video games are designed to draw the user in, most commonly done by creating a different world the user can enter, at least for a little while. Augmented reality can affect the world that we already live in to make the user more immersed in this world. Experiences like Pokemon Go and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgakdcEzVwg&t=2m30s">Minecraft on Hololens</a> are already taking advantage of this technology.</p>

					<h2>Translation</h2>
					<p>Language is one of the largest barriers that separates. It’s incredibly difficult to understand another country’s culture without having at least a basic understanding of the language. Google Translate has made great strides in remedying this with their Live Translation feature that allows the user to simply hold their phone up to text in a foreign language and see it translated live.</p>

					<h2>Sports Broadcasting</h2>
					<p>Nobody knows all the rules, and sports is no exception. Sports commentators are paid to know all the rules and tell them to everyone, a process greatly enhanced by augmented reality. They can use augmented reality to adjust what the viewer sees in real time so that viewers might better understand the happenings on the field. The most famous example may be the NFL's yellow line, which is digitally added to the field in broadcasts to allow home viewers to understand the progress of the game.</p>

				<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/Google_Glass_Main.jpg" alt="Google Glass" style="float:right;max-width:30%;padding:3px;" /> Though not the first device ever envisioned, the Google Glass is often credited with bringing the notion of augmented reality headsets into mainstream notice. First announced via a viral video titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb2uojqKvFM">One Day</a>, the Google Glass quickly attracted widespread attention, both positive and negative. Many were excited at the future promised by the video, where one's headset would allow them to quickly and easily obtain information on the fly without ever needing to look away from what they were doing. Others critiqued possible safety and privacy concerns, citing distractions and the always present camera as potential issues. Though an Explorer edition was eventually released for the general public, the device is now no longer being sold and many have speculated that Google is cutting the project entirely.</p>
				<p><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7367/15867880743_f954b09377_b.jpg" alt="Microsoft Hololens" style="float:left;max-width:40%;padding:3px;" /> First announced in 2015 alongside Windows 10, Microsoft's Hololens headset made headlines for its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXy7lbs-D48&t=4s">flashy features</a> such as the ability to visualize 3d models in the real world, run programs floating in your vision, or even playing immersive AR games. Unlike the Google Glass, this is not a device designed to be worn at all times through one's day. Rather, it's what Microsoft calls a "holographic computer" - a computer that you strap onto your head when you need to use it, and then remove once you're done. These devices run a modified version of Windows 10 that supports various capabilities needed to run programs in AR. Developer units are currently being sold, with consumer products coming down the road.</p>

				<p>Snapchat has always given users the ability to draw onto the snaps one takes. Though simple, this is <em>technically</em> augmented reality, since the computer imagery (the drawing) is being overlayed onto the video from real life.</p>
				<p>Since then, Snapchat has significantly expanded their AR offerings. The popular lenses feature uses AR technology and computer vision to detect the presence of a human face in order to add complex visuals and animations onto what the user sees, such as the rainbow barf pictured below.</p>
				<p>Just a few weeks ago, Snapchat has introduced World Lenses, a feature that allows users to place 3D objects into their view. The app will automatically analyze the surroundings and attempt to pin the object in place as if it were a real object in the world, and not just drawn onto a screen.</p>

				<p>Gaming is defined by the experience. Thus, since the dawn of video games, the struggle has always been to make gaming as immersive as possible. Augmented reality provides a valuable platform in that it allows the game world to seep into the real one, blurring the line between one's experience in real life and one's experience in a game. This level of immersion creates video games that feel more real than ever, allowing game designers to leverage the technology to craft never before seen experiences.</p>

				<p>Sportvision is the company behind most of the graphics seen during a typical game on TV. From the iconic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Oqm6eO6deU">first down line</a> during football matches that first premiered on September 27<sup>th</sup>, 1998, to the wide variety of graphics seen in modern sports broadcasts, all of this is powered with augmented reality technology. Sportvision has since gone on to make visual aids for baseball games, NASCAR races, sailing competitions, and even the Olympic games, while multiple competitors have also sprung up to complete similar tasks. </p>
